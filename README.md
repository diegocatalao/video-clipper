# Squark

This is a very small project to transform a video stream into a small
thumbnails. It`s can be useful if you need something like a YouTube thumbnail 
preview.

Must be improved with a MSE calculation of frames diff.

On smart TV's you can use this to handle backpressure on your CDNs / servers so that it doesn't require as many thumbnails. You can this images **inside** of your tv. That`s great, right?!

This project is totally based on Gstreamer, its a plugin and you will be 
set it on your pipeline.

I just wrote this with C++ to use the OpenCV. This is good enough.
